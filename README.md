3. $ `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080`
    - This runs a php server on *localhost* on port *8080*
    - In your web browser, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`


## TODO

### Build the rest of the pages

* In order to achieve this, we could start using a framework, or maybe we
  can just implement everything with html/css/js.

* So far, I've used 100vh for the `#mainPage` div; perhaps, we can simply
  keep doing this for the rest of the pages and also using some `min-width`
  properties in css to make sure that it's still readable even on smaller
  windows.


### Backend

* We also need to tie Android and iOS into the backend

* This means that we need to pick and get started setting up a backend
  (node.js?)
