## TODO

### now

### Drop-downs

+ The drop-down things need to be animated and populated with inormation:
    1. Figure out what text needs to go inside them
    2. Create the animations that span the entire screen (maybe css `:click`, but not
       super cross-platform, but should be ok?)

### "Get Updates" Button

+ Figure out what to do when "Get Updates" button is clicked and make happen
  with frontend in javascript and backend in node

### Various Resolutions

+ Looks like crap on a mobile phone and really large screens
    - "sorry" - Dylan

### Security

+ We don't have any dynamic stuff, so no need for security
+ Do we want to have an admin/login stuff? If so: definitely need security and
  potentially a framework for backend
    - Talk with person from last year who developed the website for last year's
      hackathon (Steven?)

### Backend and the Rest

+ We will need to complete all of the fun stuff that will happen while people
  are here. I don't know if this will be done in the backend or on mobile.

### Clean Code

+ Website created by someone (Dylan) who mostly creates animations in iframes,
  so not sure if everything is up-to-par.
    - Change in direction welcome.
    - Other devs: get hands dirty.
