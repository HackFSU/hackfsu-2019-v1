## Setup

0. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

1. $ `git clone https://github.com/HackFSU/hackfsu2019_com`

2. $ `cd hackfsu-spring2019`

3. $ `npm install connect static-serve`

4. $ `cd src; node server.js`
    - This runs a node server on *localhost* on port *8080*
    - In your web browser, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`

---

Alternatively, you can use [now](https://zeit.co/now), but it can be beneficial
to use the server.js node file for testing purposes. Also, now should be for
testing semi-complete deployments for testing purposes.

## Now Deployment

*When ready, deploy with now and change this to the date and time of deployment*
